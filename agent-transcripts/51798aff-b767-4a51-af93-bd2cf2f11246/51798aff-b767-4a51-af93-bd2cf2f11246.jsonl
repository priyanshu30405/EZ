{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"### Overview\n\nI’ve set up a minimal **React + TypeScript + Vite** project and implemented both required components with clean, simple code and basic styling.\n\n- **`TreeView`**: expand/collapse, add child, delete with confirmation, inline rename, drag & drop, lazy loading via `setTimeout`, proper tree structure.\n- **`KanbanBoard`**: Todo / In Progress / Done columns, add/delete cards, inline edit, drag & drop cards between columns, responsive layout.\n\n---\n\n### Project Structure\n\n- **Root**\n  - `package.json` – React + TS + Vite, basic scripts.\n  - `tsconfig.json` – strict TypeScript config.\n  - `vite.config.ts` – Vite + React plugin.\n  - `index.html` – root HTML template.\n  - `README.md` – instructions and implementation notes.\n- **`src/`**\n  - `main.tsx` – React entry, mounts `App`.\n  - `styles.css` – global app layout and panel styling.\n  - `App.tsx` – renders `TreeView` and `KanbanBoard` in a two-panel layout.\n\n- **`src/components/TreeView/`**\n  - `TreeView.types.ts` – `TreeNode` and `TreeNodeId` types.\n  - `mockTreeData.ts` – initial tree + lazy-load mock API (`loadChildrenForNode`).\n  - `TreeView.css` – styling for the tree, nodes, actions, loading indicators.\n  - `TreeNodeItem.tsx` – a single tree node row (UI + inline edit + per-node actions).\n  - `TreeView.tsx` – main tree component and tree operations.\n\n- **`src/components/KanbanBoard/`**\n  - `KanbanBoard.types.ts` – `KanbanCard`, `KanbanColumn` types.\n  - `mockKanbanData.ts` – initial three columns and mock cards.\n  - `KanbanBoard.css` – board, columns, cards, buttons, responsive layout.\n  - `KanbanCard.tsx` – single card with inline edit + delete.\n  - `KanbanColumn.tsx` – column with header, card list, add card button, drop target.\n  - `KanbanBoard.tsx` – main board + drag/drop and state management.\n\n---\n\n### Key Behaviors\n\n#### 1) Tree View Component\n\n- **Data model**\n  - Each node is a `TreeNode`:\n\n    ```ts\n    export interface TreeNode {\n      id: string;\n      label: string;\n      children?: TreeNode[];\n      isExpanded?: boolean;\n      isLoading?: boolean;\n      hasLazyChildren?: boolean; // indicates lazy-loading on expand\n    }\n    ```\n\n- **Features implemented**\n  - **Expand / collapse**\n    - Clicking the small `+ / −` button toggles `isExpanded` on the node.\n  - **Lazy loading with simulated API**\n    - Nodes with `hasLazyChildren: true` load children only on first expand.\n    - `toggleExpand`:\n      - Marks the node `isExpanded: true` and `isLoading: true` the first time it’s expanded.\n      - Calls `loadChildrenForNode(nodeId)` (in `mockTreeData.ts`) which returns mock children after a `setTimeout`.\n      - On completion, it updates the same node with `children`, and clears `isLoading` / `hasLazyChildren`.\n  - **Add child node**\n    - `+` button on each node calls `window.prompt` to get the new label.\n    - Adds a new `TreeNode` as the last child, and ensures parent `isExpanded: true`.\n  - **Delete node with confirmation**\n    - `Delete` button shows `window.confirm`.\n    - If confirmed, the node and its full subtree are removed.\n  - **Edit node name inline**\n    - Double-click node label or click `Edit`:\n      - Switches to an `<input>` with local draft state.\n      - `Enter` or blur saves; `Escape` cancels.\n  - **Drag and drop**\n    - Node labels are `draggable`.\n    - Dropping one node onto another moves the dragged node as a **child** of the target:\n      - Uses a recursive `moveNode` helper.\n      - Prevents dropping a node inside its own descendant.\n      - Keeps hierarchy valid.\n  - **Utility**\n    - “**Expand All**” button at top expands all top-level nodes.\n    - Small helper text describes double-click-to-rename and drag behavior.\n\n#### 2) Kanban Board Component\n\n- **Data model**\n  - `KanbanColumn` holds an array of `KanbanCard`:\n\n    ```ts\n    export type ColumnId = \"todo\" | \"in-progress\" | \"done\";\n\n    export interface KanbanCard {\n      id: string;\n      title: string;\n    }\n\n    export interface KanbanColumn {\n      id: ColumnId;\n      title: string;\n      cards: KanbanCard[];\n    }\n    ```\n\n- **Columns**\n  - Exactly three columns with IDs: `\"todo\"`, `\"in-progress\"`, `\"done\"`.\n  - Titles: **Todo**, **In Progress**, **Done**.\n  - Initial mock cards (similar to screenshot) defined in `mockKanbanData.ts`.\n\n- **Features implemented**\n  - **Add card**\n    - “+ Add Card” button at bottom of each column.\n    - Uses `window.prompt` for card title and appends a new card with a timestamp-based id.\n  - **Delete card**\n    - Each card has `Delete` button; uses `window.confirm`.\n  - **Edit card title inline**\n    - Double-click the card title or click `Edit` button:\n      - Renders an `<input>` with draft title.\n      - `Enter` or blur saves; `Escape` cancels.\n  - **Drag and drop between columns**\n    - Each card is `draggable`.\n    - `KanbanBoard` tracks:\n      - `draggingCardId`\n      - `draggingFromColumnId`\n      - `dragOverColumnId` (for styling).\n    - Dropping a card on another column:\n      - Removes it from original column.\n      - Appends it to the end of the target column’s `cards` array.\n      - Card order within each column is otherwise preserved.\n  - **Responsive layout**\n    - Board is a horizontal flex row on desktop.\n    - With `@media (max-width: 768px)`:\n      - Columns stack vertically and expand to full width.\n    - Columns are scrollable horizontally on narrow screens via overflow.\n\n- **Styling**\n  - Columns use small rounded cards, subtle shadows, and count badges.\n  - Cards have grab cursor and reduced opacity while dragging.\n  - Dropped-on columns highlight with a dashed outline and soft blue background.\n\n---\n\n### How to Run Locally\n\nFrom the project root (`c-Users-Priyanshu-Raj-OneDrive-Desktop-EZ`):\n\n1. **Install dependencies**\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   # or\n   yarn\n   ```\n\n2. **Start dev server**\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run dev\n   # or\n   yarn dev\n   ```\n\n3. **Open the app**\n\n   - Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever URL Vite prints).\n\n4. **Build & preview (optional)**\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   npm run preview\n   ```\n\nThis setup should be ready to zip and share as a Git repository + deployed demo for your assignment. If you’d like, I can also help you tweak the UI to more closely match the exact colors/spacing of the PDF screenshots."}]}}

{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"### 1) Why files don’t show under the `EZ` folder in VS Code / Cursor\n\nRight now you actually have **two different `EZ` folders**:\n\n- The code I generated lives in Cursor’s workspace:  \n  `C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\.cursor\\projects\\c-Users-Priyanshu-Raj-OneDrive-Desktop-EZ\\`\n- Your editor is opened on:  \n  `C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\EZ\\`\n\nThat’s why in the left sidebar you only see `package-lock.json` – the rest of the files are in the **Cursor workspace folder**, not in the OneDrive `EZ` folder you opened.\n\nTo fix this (pick one):\n\n#### Option A – Open the correct folder (easier)\n\n1. In VS Code / Cursor, go to **File → Open Folder…**.\n2. Browse to:  \n   `C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\.cursor\\projects\\c-Users-Priyanshu-Raj-OneDrive-Desktop-EZ`\n3. Open that folder.\n4. In the explorer you should now see `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `src/`, etc.\n\n#### Option B – Copy project into your OneDrive `EZ` folder\n\nIf you prefer to keep the final project in `C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\EZ` (for GitHub / Vercel):\n\n1. In File Explorer, open both folders:\n   - Source:  \n     `C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\.cursor\\projects\\c-Users-Priyanshu-Raj-OneDrive-Desktop-EZ`\n   - Destination:  \n     `C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\EZ`\n2. Copy **everything** from the Cursor project folder into the OneDrive `EZ` folder:\n   - `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (if you want), `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `src/`, etc.\n3. Back in VS Code, make sure the opened folder is `C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\EZ` and hit **Refresh** in the Explorer if needed.\n\nAfter this, the sidebar under `EZ` will show the full project.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Vercel build error (“`npm run build` exited with 126, `vite: Permission denied`”)\n\nThis usually happens when the **repo Vercel clones doesn’t exactly match the local project** or `node_modules` got committed.\n\nDo this:\n\n1. In `C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\EZ`:\n   - Make sure you see:\n     - `package.json`\n     - `tsconfig.json`\n     - `vite.config.ts`\n     - `index.html`\n     - `src/` with `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `components/…`\n2. Create a **`.gitignore`** file (if you don’t have one) with at least:\n\n   ```gitignore\n   node_modules\n   dist\n   .vercel\n   ```\n\n3. Delete any committed `node_modules` from the repo (only keep it locally).\n4. Run locally:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd \"C:\\Users\\Priyanshu Raj\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\EZ\"\n   npm install\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n   - If this works locally, commit and push all source files (but **not** `node_modules`) to GitHub.\n\n5. In Vercel project settings:\n   - Framework preset: **Vite** (or “Other” with manual settings).\n   - Build command: `npm run build`\n   - Output directory: `dist`\n\n6.
